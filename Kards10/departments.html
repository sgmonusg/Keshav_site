      <h3>Department of Sponsorship and Marketing</h3>
    </div> <!-- /section-intro -->

    <div class="row about-content containter">
      <p class="drop-cap" align="Justify">It’s probably the most important department on campus, at least in regards to fests. After all, everything you see in a fest is possible because DoSM brings in the sponsorship for these fests from different companies. If it weren’t for them, there would be no money to fund the fests. This department consists of students dedicated to our college who work hard throughout the year, contacting hundreds of companies and do the marketing of our fests. The responsibility of ensuring that the SU has enough to funds for the smooth functioning of the fests is completely upon them. </p>
    </p align="justify">The sponsorship, either in cash or in kind, is brought in different ways. The most common    process is to contact a company on phone and pitch the fest to them. Another, more tedious path that they often have to take is when they have to visit the corporate office of the companies in the city and talk to the concerned person regarding our   fest. Their job doesn’t just end at bringing in the money. They have to ensure that the promises made to the companies are fulfilled completely, to maintain a healthy working relationship with them. Doing so, also makes it easier to call them for future fests. This part includes the putting up of    huge banners, posters, dropdowns and sometimes balloons; all throughout the campus during      the fest, so that the promised publicity of the companies is done.</p> <p align="justify"> The members of this department work tirelessly throughout the duration of the fest, sacrificing their enjoyment, handing out  coupons to the students of the entire campus to ensure that the various stalls function in an organised manner. The work goes on for a few weeks after the completion of the fest as they to  have collect all the data, prepare a branding report for each company and send it to them to assure them of the work done for them on fest. Apart from all this, they are the only department which literally works all year around, even in     the vacations. During the summer break, they work for ATMOS; in winter, for Pearl and ARENA. They connect BITS to the professional world, talking to the executives of various companies.
        They also bring in separate sponsorships for Corporate Social Responsibility</p>

      <h3>Department of Publicity and Public relations</h3>
    </div> <!-- /section-intro -->

    <div class="row about-content containter">
      <p class="drop-cap" align="Justify">The Department of Publicity and Public Relations works towards increasing awareness about the campus and its multitude of fests among the masses that lie beyond our four walls. DePP is one of the few departments that are active throughout the year (in the form of online publicity).
All the endeavours that make a fest - gathering sponsorship, preparing for events and workshops, etc. - ultimately boil down to a singular metric in the eyes of the public. That metric is footfall, and we at DePP can proudly claim to be the reason for a tremendous majority of it. Whether it be centralising the flow of posters, managing of the social media presence of the fests, or making    trips to other colleges in person, DePP is responsible for it all. Due to the efforts of our many qualified members, footfall, awareness and online presence have all been increasing  exponentially every passing  year.</p>
