      <p class="drop-cap" align="Justify">Movies are the greatest form of knowledge and entertainment. We learn so much from them.

The Movie Club, BITS Hyderabad, recognizes this, and aims solely at developing the movie culture at BPHC. We have been involved in film making since our very inception. We have been very keen on writing original scripts and producing short films on campus. We have produced about 25 videos in the past three years. Also, we organize slumber parties, the all night Movie screenings during various fests throughout the year. And these slumber parties have become synonymous to the college and are the greatest attractions of any fest. This year “The Movie Thursdays” initiative was taken up by us, wherein we show various critically acclaimed movies every Thursday, including foreign movies, which have great content and value. We have successfully organized 2 editions of Catharsis Film Festival. Our motive is to entertain BPHC, and in the process, make people here familiar with the rich and beautiful world of cinema.</p>
